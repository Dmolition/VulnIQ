occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out

  - The URL pattern of  (the empty string) which exactly maps to the context root was not correctly handled
    in Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.4, 8.5.0 to 8.5.27, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.49 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.84 when used as
    part of a security constraint definition. This caused the constraint to be ignored. It was, therefore,
    possible for unauthorised users to gain access to web application resources that should have been
    protected. Only security constraints with a URL pattern of the empty string were affected. (CVE-2018-1304)

  - The error page mechanism of the Java Servlet Specification requires that, when an error occurs and an
    error page is configured for the error that occurred, the original request and response are forwarded to
    the error page. This means that the request is presented to the error page with the original HTTP method.
    If the error page is a static file, expected behaviour is to serve content of the file as if processing a
    GET request, regardless of the actual HTTP method. The Default Servlet in Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to
    9.0.0.M20, 8.5.0 to 8.5.14, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.43 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.77 did not do this. Depending on the
    original request this could lead to unexpected and undesirable results for static error pages including,
    if the DefaultServlet is configured to permit writes, the replacement or removal of the custom error page.
    Notes for other user provided error pages: (1) Unless explicitly coded otherwise, JSPs ignore the HTTP
    method. JSPs used as error pages must must ensure that they handle any error dispatch as a GET request,
    regardless of the actual method. (2) By default, the response generated by a Servlet does depend on the
    HTTP method. Custom Servlets used as error pages must ensure that they handle any error dispatch as a GET
    request, regardless of the actual method. (CVE-2017-5664)

  - A bug in the error handling of the send file code for the NIO HTTP connector in Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to

    same Processor could be used for concurrent requests. Sharing a Processor can result in information
    leakage between requests including, not not limited to, session ID and the response body. The bug was
    first noticed in 8.5.x onwards where it appears the refactoring of the Connector code for 8.5.x onwards
    made it more likely that the bug was observed. Initially it was thought that the 8.5.x refactoring
    introduced the bug but further investigation has shown that the bug is present in all currently supported
    Tomcat versions. (CVE-2016-8745)
