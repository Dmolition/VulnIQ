Description: The remote web server implements Strict Transport Security (STS).
The goal of STS is to make sure that a user does not accidentally

connection in the event of potentially insecure situations.

Plugin Name: N/A
Description: By calling the OPTIONS method, it is possible to determine which HTTP
methods are allowed on each directory.

The following HTTP methods are considered insecure:
  PUT, DELETE, CONNECT, TRACE, HEAD

Many frameworks and languages treat 'HEAD' as a 'GET' request, albeit
one without any body in the response. If a security constraint was
set on 'GET' requests such that only 'authenticatedUsers' could
access GET requests for a particular servlet or resource, it would be
bypassed for the 'HEAD' version. This allowed unauthorized blind
submission of any privileged GET request.

As this list may be incomplete, the plugin also tests - if 'Thorough
tests' are enabled or 'Enable web applications tests' is set to 'yes'
in the scan policy - various known HTTP methods on each directory and
considers them as unsupported if it receives a response code of 400,
403, 405, or 501.

Note that the plugin output is only informational and does not
necessarily indicate the presence of any security vulnerabilities.

Port: 8834
Protocol: tcp
Severity: Unknown
Plugin Name: N/A
Description: The server's X.509 certificate cannot be trusted. This situation can
occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out 
man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host.

Description: Valid credentials were provided for an authentication protocol on the
remote target and Nessus did not log any subsequent errors or failures
for the authentication protocol.

When possible, Nessus tracks errors or failures related to otherwise
valid credentials in order to highlight issues that may result in
incomplete scan results or limited scan coverage. The types of issues
that are tracked include errors that indicate that the account used
for scanning did not have sufficient permissions for a particular
check, intermittent protocol failures which are unexpected after the
protocol has been negotiated successfully earlier in the scan, and
intermittent authentication failures which are unexpected after a
credential set has been accepted as valid earlier in the scan. This
plugin reports when none of the above issues have been logged during
the course of the scan for at least one authenticated protocol. See
plugin output for details, including protocol, port, and account.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for
  issues to be encountered for one protocol and not another.
  For example, authentication to the SSH service on the
  remote target may have consistently succeeded with no
  privilege errors encountered, while connections to the SMB
  service on the remote target may have failed
  intermittently.

- Resolving logged issues for all available authentication
  protocols may improve scan coverage, but the value of
  resolving each issue for a particular protocol may vary
  from target to target depending upon what data (if any) is
  gathered from the target via that protocol and what
  particular check failed. For example, consistently
  successful checks via SSH are more critical for Linux
  targets than for Windows targets, and likewise
  consistently successful checks via SMB are more critical
  for Windows targets than for Linux targets.

Plugin Name: N/A
Description: Nessus was able to determine that valid credentials were provided for
an authentication protocol available on the remote target because it
was able to successfully authenticate directly to the remote target
using that authentication protocol at least once. Authentication was
successful because the authentication protocol service was available
remotely, the service was able to be identified, the authentication
protocol was able to be negotiated successfully, and a set of
credentials provided in the scan policy for that authentication
protocol was accepted by the remote service. See plugin output for
details, including protocol, port, and account.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for
  valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not
  another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH
  but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for
  an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available
  authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but
  the value of successful authentication for a given
  protocol may vary from target to target depending upon
  what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that
  protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH
  is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows
  targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB
  is more valuable for Windows targets than for Linux
  targets.
