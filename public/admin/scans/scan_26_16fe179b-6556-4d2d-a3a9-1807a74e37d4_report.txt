may assist an unauthenticated, remote attacker in defeating time-based

vulnerable since data is passed between the rlogin client and server

without passwords. If the host is vulnerable to TCP sequence number
guessing (from any network) or IP spoofing (including ARP hijacking on
a local network) then it may be possible to bypass authentication.
Finally, rlogin is an easy way to turn file-write access into full
logins through the .rhosts or rhosts.equiv files.

Description: The remote service accepts connections encrypted using SSL 2.0 and/or
SSL 3.0. These versions of SSL are affected by several cryptographic
flaws, including:

  - An insecure padding scheme with CBC ciphers.

  - Insecure session renegotiation and resumption schemes.

An attacker can exploit these flaws to conduct man-in-the-middle
attacks or to decrypt communications between the affected service and
clients.

Although SSL/TLS has a secure means for choosing the highest supported
version of the protocol (so that these versions will be used only if
the client or server support nothing better), many web browsers
implement this in an unsafe way that allows an attacker to downgrade
a connection (such as in POODLE). Therefore, it is recommended that
these protocols be disabled entirely.

NIST has determined that SSL 3.0 is no longer acceptable for secure
communications. As of the date of enforcement found in PCI DSS v3.1,
any version of SSL will not meet the PCI SSC's definition of 'strong
cryptography'.

Description: The server's X.509 certificate cannot be trusted. This situation can
occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out 
man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host.

Description: The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information
disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to
the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages
encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.
MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few
as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to
repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.

As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can
be 'rolled back' to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the
client and service.

The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents 'version rollback' attacks
without impacting legacy clients; however, it can only protect
connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites
that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.

This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any
particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to
completely mitigate the vulnerability.

of the host (e.g. SNMP and Netbios) and from running local checks
(e.g. ifconfig). It then consolidates the MAC addresses into a single,
unique, and uniform list.

Host: 192.168.1.20
Port: 25
Protocol: tcp
Severity: Unknown
Plugin Name: N/A
Description: The remote host supports SSLv2 and therefore may be affected by a
vulnerability that allows a cross-protocol Bleichenbacher padding
oracle attack known as DROWN (Decrypting RSA with Obsolete and
Weakened eNcryption). This vulnerability exists due to a flaw in the
Secure Sockets Layer Version 2 (SSLv2) implementation, and it allows
captured TLS traffic to be decrypted. A man-in-the-middle attacker can
exploit this to decrypt the TLS connection by utilizing previously
captured traffic and weak cryptography along with a series of
specially crafted connections to an SSLv2 server that uses the same
private key.

Description: Nessus has detected that the remote SSH server is configured to use
the Arcfour stream cipher or no cipher at all. RFC 4253 advises
against using Arcfour due to an issue with weak keys.

Host: 192.168.1.20
Port: 445
Protocol: tcp
Severity: Unknown
Plugin Name: N/A
Description: The version of Samba, a CIFS/SMB server for Linux and Unix, running on
the remote host is affected by a flaw, known as Badlock, that exists
in the Security Account Manager (SAM) and Local Security
Authority (Domain Policy) (LSAD) protocols due to improper
authentication level negotiation over Remote Procedure Call (RPC)
channels. A man-in-the-middle attacker who is able to able to
intercept the traffic between a client and a server hosting a SAM
database can exploit this flaw to force a downgrade of the
authentication level, which allows the execution of arbitrary Samba
network calls in the context of the intercepted user, such as viewing
or modifying sensitive security data in the Active Directory (AD)
database or disabling critical services.

Plugin Name: N/A
Description: The remote Windows host supports Server Message Block Protocol
version 1 (SMBv1). Microsoft recommends that users discontinue the use
of SMBv1 due to the lack of security features that were included in
later SMB versions. Additionally, the Shadow Brokers group reportedly
has an exploit that affects SMB; however, it is unknown if the exploit
affects SMBv1 or another version. In response to this, US-CERT
recommends that users disable SMBv1 per SMB best practices to mitigate
these potential issues.

Host: 192.168.1.20
Port: 25
Protocol: tcp
Severity: Unknown
Plugin Name: N/A
Description: The remote service accepts connections encrypted using TLS 1.0. TLS 1.0 has a
number of cryptographic design flaws. Modern implementations of TLS 1.0
mitigate these problems, but newer versions of TLS like 1.2 and 1.3 are
designed against these flaws and should be used whenever possible.

As of March 31, 2020, Endpoints that aren’t enabled for TLS 1.2
and higher will no longer function properly with major web browsers and major vendors.

PCI DSS v3.2 requires that TLS 1.0 be disabled entirely by June 30,
2018, except for POS POI terminals (and the SSL/TLS termination
points to which they connect) that can be verified as not being
susceptible to any known exploits.

Description: The remote SSH server is configured to enable SHA-1 HMAC algorithms.

Although NIST has formally deprecated use of SHA-1 for digital signatures, SHA-1 is still considered secure for HMAC as
the security of HMAC does not rely on the underlying hash function being resistant to collisions.

  gss-gex-sha1-*

  gss-group1-sha1-*

  gss-group14-sha1-*
